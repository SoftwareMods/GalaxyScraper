# GalaxyScraper
Galaxyaudiobook.com is an excellent resource for downloading audio books, however, it has one critical drawback in that you must listen to the audiobook through the player on the website.
This makes listening to the audiobooks a frustrating experience.  I created this tool in order to instead download the tracks so they can be used anywhere and listened to in your favorite audiobook player application.

## Steps
### Browse 
Using your web browser navigate to galaxyaudiobook.com and search for your desired book

### Copy URL
Once on the page for the book you would like to listen to, copy the URL from the browser

### Paste URL
Start GalaxyScraper and in the URL box paste in your copied URL

### Fetch
Click the Fetch button to retrieve all the track information for your book

### Select folder
Once the track information has been fetched, select a local folder to save the audio tracks to

### Listen
You can now listen to the audiobook from your PC or move to another location as desired.  For my purposes I upload the current audiobook I'm listening to my dropbox account and then download the tracks to my phone to listen to on the "BookPlayer" app on iOS
